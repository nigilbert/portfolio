  <h3>Fun Facts:</h3>
  <li>I take on a big interest in the biological science and engineering fields. I enjoy conducting research on a variety of biology topics such as genetics, anatomy, and biochemistry. Growing up with a father who is an engineer, a sister who is a double-major in computer science and biology, and a family made up of doctors, my interest/knowledge in engineering and biology continues to expand everyday!</li>
  <br/>
  <li> I enjoy being very involved in my school as an active participant in clubs such as Community Service Club, Green Group, Bridges Club, and the Big Blue Pride Club. In addition, I am a member of the Pingry Blue Key, a Pingry program used to take the minds of students to further develop the school, and the Pingry Balladeers, a women's a capella group. </li>
<br/>
    <li>Balancing with my school life, I consider sports to be a very important part of my life -- one that makes me who I am. I play tennis in the fall, basketball in the winter, softball in the spring, coach myself in soccer, and just started playing squash this past year. </li>

<h3> Key Learning</h3>
<p>This summer, 2017, I had decided to take part in Girls Who Code. What I've learned amazes me. From my teammates and my teachers, I have learned that I am capable of so much, no matter how much experience I have. I learned that making mistakes is the only thing that helps me to strengthen my knowledge and improve myself for the future. Mistakes are good!</p>
  
<h3> My Future</h3>
  <p> In the future, I hope to continue learning more about coding and deepen my knowledge in the field of engineering. I hope to spread my knowledge in coding to other girls. It's crucial and deserves much more credit! </p>
  
  <h3>My Advice</h3>
  <p>Computer Science is a field that needs more women to represent! It's our future and possibly one of the most important things everyone needs. Without it, we wouldn't have functioning phones, doctors and dentists wouldn't have any functioning equipment, buisiness people wouldn't be able to keep records, and so much more! Not only is it used for devices, but also for animations, music, and fashion! As girls, it is our duty to further develop our world. No matter what, never put yourself down. You need to believe that you can do anything, because you can!
